# mailSender
This project is a terminal-based program for sending emails from an excel sheet.

Hi! Thanks for viewing my project. The idea of this project is to send e-mails to a bulk of contacts that can be extracted from an excel sheet.
The main goal is to send to multiple emails with the the same message content, but different subject lines. You may check the sample template of database to
understand the code better. Before executing the .jar file, make sure that the Excel file you want to extract the data from is in the same folder as the .jar file.
